```

### Step 2: API Testing (5 minutes)

#### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T...",
  "services": {
    "geofencing": "active",

  }
}
```

#### Test 2: Check Geofence (Inside)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/geofence/check-location \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "venueId": 1,
    "lat": 40.7489,
    "lon": -73.9680
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**

  "isInside": false,
  "location": {
    "lat": 40.7600,
    "lon": -73.9900
  }
}
```

#### Test 4: Test All Sample Venues
```bash
# Central Railway Station (should be inside if within 300m)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/geofence/check-location \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"venueId": 1, "lat": 40.7489, "lon": -73.9680}'

# JFK Airport (should be inside if within 800m)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/geofence/check-location \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"venueId": 3, "lat": 40.7505, "lon": -73.9934}'
```

### Step 3: Database Testing (3 minutes)

```sql
-- Connect to database
psql -d publicalert

-- 1. Check venues exist
SELECT id, name, latitude, longitude, geofence_radius FROM venues;

-- 2. Check PostGIS functions work
SELECT is_inside_venue_geofence(1, 40.7489, -73.9680);
-- Expected: true (inside)

SELECT is_inside_venue_geofence(1, 40.7600, -73.9900);
-- Expected: false (outside)

-- 3. Check distance calculation
SELECT find_nearby_venues(40.7489, -73.9680, 1000);
-- Expected: List of venues within 1km

-- 4. Check spatial index is working
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM venues 
WHERE ST_DWithin(
  location,
  ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-73.9680, 40.7489), 4326),
  500
);
-- Should show "Index Scan using idx_venues_location"
```

---

## 📱 PART 2: MOBILE TESTING

### Option A: Using Your Phone (Recommended)

#### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Deploy Frontend Locally with HTTPS**
```bash
# Install mkcert for local HTTPS
# Windows: choco install mkcert
# Mac: brew install mkcert
# Linux: Follow mkcert docs

# Create certificate
mkcert localhost

# Update frontend to use HTTPS
# Then access from phone: https://your-computer-ip:3001
```

2. **Or Use ngrok (Easier)**
```bash
# Install ngrok
# Download from ngrok.com

# Expose backend
ngrok http 3000

# Expose frontend
ngrok http 3001

# Use the ngrok HTTPS URLs in your phone browser
```

#### Testing Steps

1. **Open PWA on Phone**
   - Navigate to your ngrok HTTPS URL
   - Grant location permission when prompted

2. **Walk Around**
   - Start at a location "inside" your test geofence
   - Walk away from the venue
   - Walk back towards the venue

3. **Watch the UI**
   - Status should change from "Inside" to "Outside"
   - Distance should update
   - Last update timestamp should refresh

### Option B: GPS Spoofing (For Testing Without Moving)

#### Using Chrome DevTools

1. **Open Chrome DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Sensors Tab** (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Show Sensors")
3. **Set Custom Location**

**Test Locations:**
```javascript
// Central Railway Station (Inside - 300m radius)
Lat: 40.7489, Lon: -73.9680

// Just Outside (400m away)
Lat: 40.7525, Lon: -73.9680

// Far Away (1km away)
Lat: 40.7580, Lon: -73.9680

// JFK Airport (Inside - 800m radius)
Lat: 40.6413, Lon: -73.7781
```

4. **Test Sequence**:
   - Set location inside venue → Should show "✅ Inside"
   - Wait 5 minutes (or trigger manual update)
   - Change to outside location → Should show "❌ Outside"
   - Wait 30 minutes → Should auto-unsubscribe

---

## 🎬 PART 3: AUTO-UNSUBSCRIBE TESTING

### Method 1: Accelerated Testing (For Demo)

Temporarily reduce the grace period for faster testing:

```javascript
// backend/services/geofencing.service.js
// Change line 14 from:
this.EXIT_GRACE_PERIOD = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes

// To:
this.EXIT_GRACE_PERIOD = 2 * 60 * 1000; // 2 minutes (for testing)
```

**Test Sequence:**
1. Register user inside geofence
2. Move user outside geofence
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Run cleanup job manually or wait for cron
5. Check user is unsubscribed

**Manual Cleanup Trigger:**
```bash
# In Node.js console or create test script
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test/trigger-cleanup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Method 2: Database Monitoring

```sql
-- Watch subscription status in real-time
\watch 1
SELECT 
  u.device_id,
  v.name as venue,
  s.subscribed_at,
  s.last_seen_at,
  s.outside_since,
  s.active,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - s.outside_since))/60 as minutes_outside
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN users u ON s.user_id = u.id
JOIN venues v ON s.venue_id = v.id
WHERE s.outside_since IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY s.outside_since DESC;
```

### Method 3: Log Monitoring

```bash
# Watch server logs
tail -f logs/app.log | grep -E "(unsubscribe|geofence|cleanup)"
```
