# 🎯 System Testing Summary

## ✅ What's Currently Running

1. **✅ Backend Server** - Running in a separate CMD window on port 3000
2. **✅ Haptic Test Page** - Opened in your browser
3. **⏳ ML Model** - Ready to start (see instructions below)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Test Everything Now

### Step 1: Subscribe to Alerts

In the browser (haptic test page that just opened):

1. Click the **"Subscribe to Alerts"** button
2. Wait for confirmation: "✅ Subscribed successfully!"

---

### Step 2: Start the ML Model

**Open a NEW PowerShell terminal** (don't close the existing ones) and run:

```powershell
cd e:\Projects\HackQuest25\frontend
python model.py
```

**Wait for:**
```
INFO - Whisper model loaded successfully
INFO - Listening for speech...
```

---

### Step 3: Test with Your Voice

Speak these announcements clearly into your microphone:

#### Test Announcement 1 (Airport):
> **"Attention all passengers, flight AA123 is now boarding at gate 5"**

#### Test Announcement 2 (Office):
> **"Please note that the meeting room on the 3rd floor is now available"**

#### Test Announcement 3 (University):
> **"All students, kindly proceed to the main hall for the event"**

---

## 📊 What to Look For

### In Python Terminal (model.py):
```
✅ Speech detected
✅ Transcription: "Attention all passengers..."
✅ ANNOUNCEMENT DETECTED AND SAVED
✅ Alert triggered successfully
```

### In Backend CMD Window:
```
📳 Haptic Alert Triggered
🔔 Sending alert to 1 subscribed devices
```

### In Browser:
- 🔔 Visual alert notification
- 📳 Phone vibration (if on mobile)
- 📝 Alert message displayed

---

## 🧪 Quick Manual Tests

### Test 1: Button Tests (in browser)

Click these buttons on the haptic test page:

1. **🔔 Test HELP Alert** - Should vibrate/show notification
2. **🚨 Test SOS Alert** - Emergency pattern
3. **📢 Test Announcement** - Public address pattern

### Test 2: Backend Health Check

Open a PowerShell and run:

```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"healthy",...}`

### Test 3: Database Verification

1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/akblmbpxxotmebzghczj
2. Go to **Table Editor** → **transcriptions**
3. You should see your detected announcements

## 🎬 Complete Test Sequence

### The Golden Path:

1. ✅ Backend running (separate CMD)
2. ✅ Browser open with haptic test
3. ✅ Click "Subscribe to Alerts"
4. ⏳ **Start ML model** (`python model.py`)
5. 🎤 **Speak**: "Attention all passengers, flight AA123 is now boarding"
6. ⏱️ **Wait 8-15 seconds**
7. ✅ **See alert** in browser
8. ✅ **Feel vibration** (if on phone)
9. ✅ **Check database** for saved transcription

## ⏱️ Performance Expectations

| Stage | Time |
|-------|------|
| Detect speech | 2-5 sec |
| Transcribe | 3-8 sec |
| Save to DB | <1 sec |
| Trigger alert | <1 sec |
| Show in browser | <1 sec |
| **TOTAL** | **~8-15 seconds** |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend not responding:
- Check the CMD window for errors
- Restart: Close CMD, run `start-system.bat` again

### Python won't start:
```powershell
pip install openai-whisper supabase pyaudio python-dotenv
```

### Microphone not working:
- Windows Settings → Privacy → Microphone → Allow apps
- Check device is not muted
- Try unplugging/replugging

### Announcements not detected:
- Speak **louder** and **clearer**
- Use **formal language** (not casual conversation)
- Check logs in `frontend/audio_transcription.log`

### Haptic alerts not showing:
- Click "Subscribe to Alerts" again
- Check backend CMD is running
- Try test buttons first
- Press F12 in browser to see console errors
