## 🧪 Test Coordinates for Demos

### Inside Tests (These will work!)

**Ernakulam Station** (center):
```javascript
Lat: 9.9710, Lon: 76.2910
```

**Airport** (Terminal 2 area):
```javascript
Lat: 10.1550, Lon: 76.4000
```

**Lulu Mall** (main entrance):
```javascript
Lat: 10.0278, Lon: 76.3090
```

**Rajagiri Campus** (main building):
```javascript
Lat: 9.9935, Lon: 76.3585
```

### Outside Tests

**Between all venues** (will show OUTSIDE):
```javascript
Lat: 10.0000, Lon: 76.3000
```

## ✅ What Changed in the SQL File

1. **All polygon_coordinates arrays updated** with actual KML data
2. **Centroid coordinates recalculated** to match polygon centers
3. **Coordinate order**: [latitude, longitude] (PostGIS standard)
4. **Polygon closure**: Last point = First point (required for valid polygons)

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The SQL file (`kochi-venues-setup.sql`) is now ready with accurate coordinates!

**To deploy:**

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor:
   https://app.supabase.com/project/akblmbpxxotmebzghczj/editor

2. Paste the updated `kochi-venues-setup.sql`

3. Run the script

4. Verify with this query:
```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    array_length(polygon_coordinates, 1) as polygon_points
FROM venues
WHERE active = true
ORDER BY name;
```

**Expected output:**
```
Name                           | Lat      | Lon     | Points
-------------------------------|----------|---------|--------
Cochin International Airport   | 10.1550  | 76.4000 | 12
Ernakulam Junction...          | 9.9710   | 76.2910 | 12
Lulu Mall Kochi                | 10.0278  | 76.3090 | 12
Rajagiri School...             | 9.9935   | 76.3585 | 28
```

## 📝 Notes

- **Coordinate Format**: KML uses `lon,lat` but PostGIS uses `[lat, lon]` - already converted ✅
- **Polygon Validation**: All polygons are closed (first point = last point) ✅
- **Fallback Radius**: Each venue still has a radius value for simple distance checks ✅
- **Accuracy**: These are the EXACT boundaries from your Google Maps KML export ✅

---

## 🎯 Testing the Accuracy

After deployment, you can test with this SQL query:

```sql
-- Test if a point is inside Lulu Mall
SELECT 
    name,
    ST_Contains(
        ST_GeomFromText(
            'POLYGON((' || 
            array_to_string(
                ARRAY(
                    SELECT polygon_coordinates[i][2]::text || ' ' || polygon_coordinates[i][1]::text
                    FROM generate_series(1, array_length(polygon_coordinates, 1)) i
                ), ', '
            ) || '))', 
            4326
        ),
        ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(76.3090, 10.0278), 4326)
    ) as is_inside
FROM venues
WHERE name = 'Lulu Mall Kochi';
```

Should return: `is_inside = true` ✅

**Your venues now have ACCURATE coordinates from Google Maps! 🎯**
