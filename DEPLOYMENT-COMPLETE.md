## 🔧 System Architecture

```
User Device (Mobile Browser)
    ↓
HTTPS (App Engine SSL)
    ↓
login-mypublicwifi.html
    ↓
[User Registers] → Supabase (wifi_subscriptions table)
    ↓
location-monitor.js starts
    ↓
Every 2 minutes:
    ├─ Get GPS coordinates
    ├─ Fetch venues from Supabase
    ├─ Check if inside any polygon (ray casting)
    │   ├─ Inside → Update last_seen, keep active=true
    │   └─ Outside → Set active=false, stop monitoring
    └─ Store state in localStorage
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Open on Mobile Device
**URL:** https://hackquest25.el.r.appspot.com

⚠️ **Important:** Must use mobile device with GPS. Desktop browsers use IP-based location (inaccurate).

### Step 2: Register
1. Enter phone number (format: +919876543210)
2. Select language
3. Click "Allow" when prompted for location access
4. Wait for success message

### Step 3: Monitor Console Logs
Open browser console (Chrome: Menu → More Tools → Developer Tools → Console)

**Expected logs every 2 minutes:**
```
[LocationMonitor] Checking geofence status...
[LocationMonitor] Current position: 9.9710, 76.2910
[LocationMonitor] Checking 4 venues...
[LocationMonitor] Inside venue: Ernakulam Junction Railway Station
[LocationMonitor] Subscription updated: active=true
```

### Step 4: Verify in Database
Open Supabase SQL Editor:  
https://app.supabase.com/project/akblmbpxxotmebzghczj/editor

```sql
-- Check all subscriptions
SELECT 
    phone,
    venue_id,
    active,
    last_seen,
    created_at
FROM wifi_subscriptions
ORDER BY last_seen DESC;

-- Check venue details
SELECT 
    name,
    type,
    CASE 
        WHEN polygon_coordinates IS NOT NULL THEN 'Polygon'
        ELSE 'Circle'
    END as geofence_type,
    active
FROM venues
WHERE active = true;
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### When User is INSIDE a Venue
- ✅ Location checked every 2 minutes
- ✅ `active = true` in database
- ✅ `last_seen` timestamp updates
- ✅ User receives announcements/transcriptions
- ✅ Console shows: "Inside venue: [venue name]"

### When User LEAVES a Venue
- ✅ Location monitor detects exit
- ✅ `active = false` in database
- ✅ Auto-unsubscribed from alerts
- ✅ No more announcements sent
- ✅ Console shows: "Outside all venues - unsubscribing"

### When User Re-enters a Venue
- ✅ System detects re-entry
- ✅ `active = true` again
- ✅ Subscription reactivated
- ✅ Announcements resume

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Location Permission Denied
**Solution:** 
- Check browser settings → Site settings → Location → Allow
- Must use HTTPS (✅ automatic on App Engine)

### Problem: Location Not Updating
**Solution:**
- Open console (F12) to see errors
- Check GPS is enabled on device
- Verify internet connection

### Problem: Not Detecting Venue Entry
**Solution:**
- Confirm you're physically inside the venue
- Check coordinates in console match venue polygon
- Wait up to 2 minutes for next location check

### Problem: Database Not Updating
**Solution:**
- Verify Supabase anon key in `login-mypublicwifi.html`
- Check RLS policies allow inserts
- Look for errors in browser console
